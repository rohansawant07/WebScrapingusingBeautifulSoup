# WebScrapingusingBeautifulSoup
Web Scraping an Ecommerce website using BeautifulSoup

In this project we have used BeautifulSoup and RegEx to scrape an ecommerce web page and get the availability details of a product to identify if it is in stock or not.
Follow the steps to run this project.
On the command line
pip install BeautifulSoup4

Then run the python file in the appropriate environment and it will automatically create a csv file to store the date into it.
